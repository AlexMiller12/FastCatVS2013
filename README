-Need to put glew.dll, glew32.dll, and glfw3.dll into maya 2016 bin folder

# Update 3/10/2016
Implemented a basic ShaderHelper class. Currently, it does:
1. Create a shader from a file;
2. Create a shader program from one or more shader files;
3. ShaderHelper::getUniformLocation() that returns a uniform location providing
   program name/ID and name of the uniform. It returns -1 if uniform is not found.
